It may be hazardous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to- mouth resuscitation when the inhaled or ingested material is toxic, infectious, or corrosive. Do not use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; induce artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device. Get medical attention immediately.",
        "Ingestion": "Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. If vomiting occurs, keep head low so that vomit does not enter lungs. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical attention immediately.",
        "Skin Contact": "Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Wash skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Wash clothing before reuse. Get medical attention immediately.",
        "Eye Contact": "Check for and remove contact lenses if present and easy to do. Immediately flush eyes with gentle but large stream of water for at least 15 minutes, lifting lower and upper eyelids occasionally. Get medical attention immediately.",
        "General Advice": "Poison information centers in each state can provide additional assistance for scheduled poisons. Ensure that medical personnel and those providing first aid are aware of the material(s) involved and take precautions to protect themselves.",
        "Symptoms and Effects": "Inhalation of vapors may cause coughing and dizziness. Ingestion may cause nausea, vomiting, blood in vomit, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and shock.
